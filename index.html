      <h1>Welcome to Manitoba's Mining Industry</h1>
      <p>
        Manitoba's mining industry has a long-standing history. But is it
        sustainable and good for the communities and the enviroment?

      <h2>Learn more</h2>
      <p>
        Take the time to go through the site and learn about the different
        recent silica projects. Learn about the impact they have on our local
        environment and how we can make a difference to keep our community
        clean. Silica is a carcinogen and can cause an illness know as
        silicosis. 300000 tonnes of silica sand will be mined. This sand will
        also use chemicals during a certain stage and will further damage the
        enviroment. Communities will be affected negatively and will not recieve
        much benifit.

      <h1>Actionable Steps..</h1>
      <p>
        Learn about the different things you can do to fight back and keep our
        environment safe
      </p>
      <p>
        Research and Educate: Teaching others about recent events and
        understanding the impacts of silica mining in Manitoba. Spread awareness
        on the subject and organize presentations on these subjects to inform
        people who may not be in the know.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Engage with those making the decisions. Talk with people who might be
        behind the silica mining and talk to them about the different negative
        effects it has on our environment. If you can't talk to them directly
        you can send a letter/email or send a post online to get their
        attention.
