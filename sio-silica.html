      <h1>Sio Silica Project</h1>
      <p>
        The Sio Silica proposed a silica sand mining project where they were to
        extract the silica. This proposal was rejected by the Manitoba
        government because of its enviromental concerns.
      </p>

      <h2>Silica Mining Impacts and Considerations</h2>
      <h3>Environmental Concerns:</h3>
      <p>
        The Sio Silica mining project would have led to contamination of
        drinking water. This is because of the aquifers in the ground which
        provide clean drinking groundwater. This mining project would have also
        lead to disruption of many living organisms habitats. This would cause
        an inbalance. The silica dust would have reduced the air quality, and
        also caused silicosis, which is a lung disease and would have impacted
        many people living in the community. People live only a few kilometers
        from the mining sites, and the provincial government sells cottages only
        a few hundred meters from the site.
      </p>

      <h3>Reasons for Mining Silica:</h3>
      <p>
        It is often used in making solar panels, which Sio Silica was proposing.
        It is used in glass products and in semiconductor chips. Semiconductor
        chips are used to make electronic devices, which use microprocessors to
        make fast calculations.
      </p>

      <h3>Silicosis:</h3>
      <p>
        Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust. The people
        in the surrounding area, living in the community would have been
        negatively impacted. There are also health risks with working in silica
        mining. There are people living in these areas. Children shouldn't have
        to deal with a silica mine next to their backyards.
      </p>

      <h3>Aquifer Concerns:</h3>
      <p>
        The aquifer is a layer of rock underground which contains water. They
        are used for drinking water, irrigation, and other uses. The aquifer is
        vital to many people and provides water for many uses. It get
        replenished whenver precipitation seeps into it. Extracting the sand and
        damaging this layer can be detrimental to the quality of water.
