      <p>
        The Hollow Water mining project was approved unlike the Sio Silica
        project, despite sharing many of the same fundamental flaws. This
        project also raises concerns about air and water quality. This is also
        happening on First Nation territory, even though there are many against
        the project.
      </p>
      <h2>Silica Mining Impacts and Considerations</h2>
      <h3>Environmental Concerns:</h3>
      <p>
        The Hollow Water mining project would have led to contamination of
        drinking water. This is because of the aquifers in the ground which
        provide clean drinking groundwater. This mining project would have also
        lead to disruption of many living organisms habitats. This would cause
        an inbalance. The silica dust would have reduced the air quality, and
        also caused silicosis, which is a lung disease and would have impacted
        many people living in the community. People live only a few kilometers
        from the mining sites, and the provincial government sells cottages only
        a few hundred meters from the site. It is also near Lake Winnipeg, which
        is where lots of our drinking water comes from.
      </p>

      <h3>Reasons for Mining Silica:</h3>
      <p>
        It is often used in making solar panels. It is used in glass products
        and in semiconductor chips. Semiconductor chips are used to make
        electronic devices, which use microprocessors to make fast calculations.
        Hollow Water is planning to use silica sand extracted near Hollow Water
        to be used in solar panels.
      </p>

      <h3>Silicosis:</h3>
      <p>
        Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust. The people
        in the surrounding area, living in the community would have been
        negatively impacted. There are also health risks with working in silica
        mining. There are people living in these areas. Children shouldn't have
        to deal with a silica mine next to their backyards.
      </p>

      <h3>Aquifer Concerns:</h3>
      <p>
        The aquifer is a layer of rock underground which contains water. They
        are used for drinking water, irrigation, and other uses. The aquifer is
        vital to many people and provides water for many uses. It get
        replenished whenver precipitation seeps into it. Extracting the sand and
        damaging this layer can be detrimental to the quality of water.
